							With exponential growth, UPAX needed new branding and a new
							platform to meet the demand of its customers.
							<br />
							<br />
							UPAX is an startup that began operating in 2011, the company is in
							the top 3 of the bigest research companys in México and top 10 of
							the Mexican Association of Market Research Agencies (AMAI).

							For the branding in conjunction with the CEO and other team
							members, started to brainstorm to generate ideas about, where we
							want to arrive with the new branding? What do we want to
							communicate? Is where there emerged the name UPAX, another hand,
							for the first version of our app, we started with interviews with
							the real users of our platform, which that in reality, that
							platform were excel pages or pdf's with instructions to perform
							the research tasks for our intern customers, at the pair I started
							work in the creative and graphic branding concept.

							Let's start with the brand, the creative process for the naming
							came up with the idea of PAX which is the international
							abbreviation used in the travel industry to designate the word
							"passenger" and the "U" was added to give strength to the
							phonetics and give way to a unique concept 'UPAX'. The identity is
							represented with a symbol of its 4 business areas,
							<span class="p-bold">Research and Knowledge</span>
							which is responsible for having a deep knowledge of consumers,
							followed by
							<span class="p-bold">Marketing Experience</span>
							which performs relevant experiences to link customers with brands,
							<span class="p-bold">Trade Marketing</span>
							which is responsible for promoters at points of sale and
							<span class="p-bold">UPAXER</span>
							is how they call the community of users of the app, represented by
							the color segment. I am so proud of myself when I see my creative
							job at the top of the corporate building

							For the app, we began by defining the functionalities that it
							should have, such as information such as the address and
							geolocation of the businesses to be evaluated, the tasks to be
							carried out together with the instructions, and a step-by-step
							manual, as well as a section to upload audio evidence. , video and
							photography, user registration, the profile section where you can
							check the agenda, new, pending and completed tasks, accumulated
							rewards, payments, etc., it was a fairly complex process since it
							was a project that we started from 0 We started with low fidelity
							cardboard prototypes to make the flows and first screens, then we
							started with high fidelity designs that changed a lot over time as
							you can see in the previous images.

							<li>
								It was a great experience to have been part of the pioneers of a
								company that has not stopped growing
							</li>
							<li>
								It was my first approach to UX and my first project for an app
								of that magnitude
							</li>
							<li>
								I had the opportunity to know the first interface design guides
								and see the evolution of realistic designs from the first
								interfaces to a flat design
							</li>
							<li>
								I feel very fortunate to see how a branding project in which
								work now is known internationally, since UPAX has presence in
								countries Peru, Colombia, Guatemala and Spain among others.
