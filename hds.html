						<p>
							Consultando HDS stems from the need to resolve and clarify
							concerns raised by external consultants regarding products,
							certifications, assessments, specifications and issues of general
							interest.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5">
						<h2 class="title">Problem space</h2>
						<p>
							The problem began when they found themselves overwhelmed to answer
							calls from coaches and independent consultants looking for advice,
							doubts about products, quotes, certifications, registrations, etc.
							Which caused delays and lost potential sales.

						<h3 class="title">Research</h3>
						<p>
							After meetings with stakeholders and analyzing and studying the
							data, we found that they had a variety of consultation materials
							scattered on their website, social networks, videos on streaming
							platforms, printed brochures, the reasons for the calls were
							usually the same questions and customer inquiries. , and this
							situation meant that the quotes always took time to arrive since
							everything was done with conventional methods and this complicated
							the closing of sales.

						<p>
							The client asked us to work on a solution in which we could
							collect all the information, documents, multimedia material, etc.,
							organize it and so that it was easily accessible and the
							consultants had as much information as possible and had a more
							agile purchase decision. The next step was information
							architecture, our goal was to collect all the relevant materials
							and make them easily accessible to users in order to help them
							understand each product. To achieve this, a product catalog, a
							15-minute personalized consultation scheduling system, and a
							certification calendar were created. This served as the basis for
							creating the initial wireframes.

						<h3>User Test</h3>
						<p>
							After the first prototype we did a test with the users, we sent
							the prototype to a sample of users to give us their impressions,
							and we applied a survey to obtain usability feedback.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							The first change arose from this test, the quotes button initially
							sent to a WhatsApp chat, with this we decided to create a form to
							better filter leads, and added a frequently asked questions
							section.

						<h3>Learnings</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								It was a project that left me many lessons from the ideation to
								the launch of a product that helps users to better connect with
								the company.
							</li>
							<li>
								In this project I faced various challenges, since I was involved
								from the ideation, research, testing, UI design, development and
								launch, although I am not a developer, I rely on available tools
								to carry out the project, I also get involved in the process for
								the publication of the application in the official stores.
							</li>
							<li>
								What would have done better? At that time, I did not know much
								theory about UX, so I omitted empathy maps, user journey,
								inclusive design, in others, so the result could be better.
							</li>
